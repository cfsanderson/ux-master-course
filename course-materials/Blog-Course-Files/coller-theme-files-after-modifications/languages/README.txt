The Language Files could be Outdated. We Updated our Theme in Version 1.1.6.3 where a lot of new strings were added, but only in the options panel. So, if you would like to see the theme admin instructions in your native language, it is recommened to re-build .mo files for your language using the coller.pot present in the folder.

# 56. Socializing and Validating Your IA Model  

## Tree testing

- similar to card sorting but sort cards into predefined "bucket" categories.
- if there is agreement about which cards go in which buckets, then those buckets should perform well in the IA.
- ***BUT*** while closed card sorting mimics how users may file a particular item of content, it doesn't necessarily model how users find information in a website or system.  

### Takeaway:

### 1) model site structure on index cards

### 2) give participants "find it" scenarios

### 3) record activity during session

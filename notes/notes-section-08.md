# 73. "What's It Gonna Look Like?" An Introduction to Design  

**Appropriate** Visual Communication  

- **expectations** are first formed **visually**  
- audience-appropriate: users, readers, or viewers?  
- clear interaction cues  
- visual brand differentiation

# 74. Defining Appropriate User Interface (UI) Design  

visual design => visual language

## Appropriate UI design  

The most important role of the UI is to **encourage** the visitor to find out what's beyond that first screen. And if you do get them in the door, you can't **confuse** or **frustrate** them.  

Appropriate UI design enables visitors to do **what they came to do, what they _want_ to do**.  

It's no wonder that Google has had such monstrous success while surrounded by millions of sites that have failed: **its compass is often worth more than the land** it helps us navigate.  

## Better urban planning

In order for you UI Design to be **appropriate**, three things have to happen:  

1) It cannot be **generic**.
2) It has to be informed by the **type of audience** who will use the website.
3) It should represent your (or your client's) **brand identity**.

### 1) Defy the generic

With media overload at an all time high, dull, generic interactive experiences are all around us:  

- Thousands of apps that are all essentially **variations on a single idea.**
- Repsonsive websites that **all use the same basic visual template**.
- Social media sites all **essentially providing the same service** while calling it something different.  

#### TAKEAWAY: If no one hates your website, **no one loves it either**  

Generic UI design is easy, but it's unmemorable. And unmemorable means quickly forgotten and abandoned. Question your conventions:  
- Is your background always white?
- Do you always use horizontal navigation?
- Do you always use an image carousel on the home page?
- Do you sacrifice navigation cues for content in the name of "flat" design?

#### TAKEAWAY: A widespread style trend is not proof that it's the best or most intuitive idea for your UI - **it means most people imitate instead of innovate.**  

### 2) Audience first.  

**Trying to be everything to everybody rearely works.** Is it an entertaining blog, an impartial resource or a glorified sales brochure?  

**The Web isn't software, or TV, or print, but it functions in similar ways.** That function (and form) depends enteirly on who it's for - users, viewers, or readers.  

#### Users  

- **Clear navigation and text:** things should be plainly marked and easily understood.  
- **Users have no patience for digression,** or for multi-tiered layers that stand between them and the information they seek.
- **Users expect sites to load quickly,** to accomodate any kind of device or connection, and to use the most broadly compatibile web technologies.  

#### Viewers  

- **Viewers want to be surprised, seduced, led along a path.** Their goal is the journey, not the end result.
- **Animation, motion, and video** are both desired and expected.
- **Even when the subject is business, the audience may be made up of viewers.** Black negative shows off its work with an animated UI: blacknegative.com/#!/bose/
  - that site is ***NOT*** very intuitive
    - locked out of navigation
    - auto play music

#### Readers  
- **Readers turn to a web site as they might turn to a novel or magazine article.** They expect and want to invest time.
- **Visual cues in the UI should signal ROI.** [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) shows estimated time it will take the viewer to read an article.  
- **Blogs are for readers.** Lots of negative space, large fonts, frequent paragraph and page breaks to ease eye strain.  

### 3) Brand matters.  

- **Your UI has to be as uniquely _you_ as it can be.** In content, presentation, and navigation.
- **If I can replace the logo on your site with someone else's** - and everything still works together visually and verbally - your UI design is generic.
- **Building an unique, memorable visual brand identity is one way smaller organizations get larger.** It's also how the larger ones stay on top.  

Your website - in form, content, and funtction - must **communicate your brand identity:**
- What does this person, product, or service do that makes it so **different**?
- What has this organization done lately that makes it **stand out**?
- What is your greatest and clearest **strength**?
- Why should anyone **care**?

# 73. "What's It Gonna Look Like?" An Introduction to Design  

**Appropriate** Visual Communication  

- **expectations** are first formed **visually**  
- audience-appropriate: users, readers, or viewers?  
- clear interaction cues  
- visual brand differentiation

# 74. Defining Appropriate User Interface (UI) Design  

visual design => visual language

## Appropriate UI design  

The most important role of the UI is to **encourage** the visitor to find out what's beyond that first screen. And if you do get them in the door, you can't **confuse** or **frustrate** them.  

Appropriate UI design enables visitors to do **what they came to do, what they _want_ to do**.  

It's no wonder that Google has had such monstrous success while surrounded by millions of sites that have failed: **its compass is often worth more than the land** it helps us navigate.  

## Better urban planning

In order for your UI Design to be **appropriate**, three things have to happen:  

1) It cannot be **generic**.
2) It has to be informed by the **type of audience** who will use the website.
3) It should represent your (or your client's) **brand identity**.

### 1) Defy the generic

With media overload at an all time high, dull, generic interactive experiences are all around us:  

- Thousands of apps that are all essentially **variations on a single idea.**
- Repsonsive websites that **all use the same basic visual template**.
- Social media sites all **essentially providing the same service** while calling it something different.  

#### TAKEAWAY: If no one hates your website, **no one loves it either**  

Generic UI design is easy, but it's unmemorable. And unmemorable means quickly forgotten and abandoned. Question your conventions:  
- Is your background always white?
- Do you always use horizontal navigation?
- Do you always use an image carousel on the home page?
- Do you sacrifice navigation cues for content in the name of "flat" design?

#### TAKEAWAY: A widespread style trend is not proof that it's the best or most intuitive idea for your UI - **it means most people imitate instead of innovate.**  

### 2) Audience first.  

**Trying to be everything to everybody rarely works.** Is it an entertaining blog, an impartial resource or a glorified sales brochure?  

**The Web isn't software, or TV, or print, but it functions in similar ways.** That function (and form) depends entirely on who it's for - users, viewers, or readers.  

#### Users  

- **Clear navigation and text:** things should be plainly marked and easily understood.  
- **Users have no patience for digression,** or for multi-tiered layers that stand between them and the information they seek.
- **Users expect sites to load quickly,** to accomodate any kind of device or connection, and to use the most broadly compatibile web technologies.  

#### Viewers  

- **Viewers want to be surprised, seduced, led along a path.** Their goal is the journey, not the end result.
- **Animation, motion, and video** are both desired and expected.
- **Even when the subject is business, the audience may be made up of viewers.** Black negative shows off its work with an animated UI: blacknegative.com/#!/bose/
  - that site is ***NOT*** very intuitive
    - locked out of navigation
    - auto play music

#### Readers  
- **Readers turn to a web site as they might turn to a novel or magazine article.** They expect and want to invest time.
- **Visual cues in the UI should signal ROI.**
  - [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) shows estimated time it will take the viewer to read an article.  
- **Blogs are for readers.**
  - Lots of negative space, large fonts, frequent paragraph and page breaks to ease eye strain.  

### 3) Brand matters.  

- **Your UI has to be as uniquely _you_ as it can be.** In content, presentation, and navigation.
- **If I can replace the logo on your site with someone else's** - and everything still works together visually and verbally - your UI design is generic.
- **Building an unique, memorable visual brand identity is one way smaller organizations get larger.** It's also how the larger ones stay on top.  

Your website - in form, content, and funtction - must **communicate your brand identity:**
- What does this person, product, or service do that makes it so **different**?
- What has this organization done lately that makes it **stand out**?
- What is your greatest and clearest **strength**?
- Why should anyone **care**?

# 75. How Definition and IA Inform UI Design  

## Revisit your strategy  

![screenshot-088](../img/screenshots-088.jpg)  

## IA = information priority  

![screenshot-089](../img/screenshots-089.jpg)  
![screenshot-090](../img/screenshots-090.jpg)  

## Takeaway:  

Every UI decision you make should provide **visible evidence of value.**

# 76. Timeless UI Design Principles, Part 01  

## Affordance
- **Physical characteristics** of an element suggest and influence how it's used.
- Onscreen this is **purely visual** - buttons and fields, for example. 
- It should be **inconceivable** that the design could function or be used any other way.
- Design individual elements - and the app or site as a whole - to **afford intended function** and **discourage improper use.**

![screenshot-092](../img/screenshots-092.jpg)  

## Closure  

When an object is **incomplete** - but enough of it is indicated - the mind percieves the object to be whole by **mentally filling the information.**

![screenshot-093](../img/screenshots-093.jpg)  
![screenshot-094](../img/screenshots-094.jpg)  

![screenshot-095](../img/screenshots-095.jpg)  
![screenshot-096](../img/screenshots-096.jpg)  

## Consistency  

Usability is improved when similar parts are expressed in similar ways. Consistency in aesthetic style & appearance:  

- enhances **recognition**  
![screenshot-097](../img/screenshots-097.jpg)  

- communicates **membership**  
![screenshot-098](../img/screenshots-098.jpg)  

- sets emotional **expectation**  
![screenshot-099](../img/screenshots-099.jpg)  

- establishes & reinforces unique identity  
![screenshot-100](../img/screenshots-100.jpg)  

**Functional** consistency
![screenshot-101](../img/screenshots-101.jpg)  

Good:

Not Good: "death by a thousand cuts"

## Continuation

![screenshot-105](../img/screenshots-105.jpg)  

## Face-ism ratio  

- ratio of **face-to-body** in an image influences the way the person in the image is perceived.  
- face focuses attention on **intellectual** and **personality** attributes.  
- body focuses attention on **physical** and **sensual** attributes.

![screenshot-107](../img/screenshots-107.jpg)  

![screenshot-108](../img/screenshots-108.jpg)  
![screenshot-109](../img/screenshots-109.jpg)  

## Enclosure  

Things that appear to have a boundary around them ar perceived to be **grouped** - and therefore **related** (e.g. Twitter's UI).  

![screenshot-110](../img/screenshots-110.jpg)  

## Figure-ground relationship  

- **figure:** definite shape, close
- **ground:** shapeless, far  
- stable relationship focuses **attention**  
- minimizes perceptual **confusion**  
- increases **recognition** of key elements  
- ambiguous relationships make bad communication design!  

![screenshot-111](../img/screenshots-111.jpg)  
![screenshot-112](../img/screenshots-112.jpg)  

- **transparent, darker background** de-emphasizes existing content.  
- **contrast** between modal window color and darker transparent background.
- manipulating the **figure-ground relationship** makes this workflow clear.

![screenshot-113](../img/screenshots-113.jpg)  

- Deiter Rams' **final principle** for good design states "as little design as possible."
- What's the **least amount of detail** that can be added to create the necessary impact?
- Applying Gestalt principles like figure-ground creates focus on the **essential meaning** in your UI.

![screenshot-114](../img/screenshots-114.jpg)  

## Similarity  
- Similar are perceived to be part of a **group** or **pattern**  
- Pinterest **entries** are all visually similar
- **Interaction patterns** for each entry are also similar.  

![screenshot-115](../img/screenshots-115.jpg)

# 78. Timeless UI Design Principles, Part 03  

## Fitt's law  
The time required to move to a target area (e.g. tap or click a button) is a function of:  
- **distance** to the target
- **size** of the target

![screenshot-119](../img/screenshots-119.jpg)  
![screenshot-120](../img/screenshots-120.jpg)  

## Occam's razor  
The **simplest** solution is usually the **best** solution:
- minimize cognitive effect
- **recognition** over recall
- make things look like what ehy are in **real life** (skeumorphism)

![screenshot-121](../img/screenshots-121.jpg)  

If you take this principle one step further, you keep the visual metaphor, but **simplify visual presentation.**   

![screenshot-122](../img/screenshots-122.jpg)  

In other words, you create **flat design**.

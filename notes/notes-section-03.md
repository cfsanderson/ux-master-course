# 12. Business Stakeholder Research  

Clients are people too!  

- Business objectives - making or saving $$$
- How do they *define* success?
- How will they *measure* it?
- Who is their *competition*?

# 16. Identifying User Needs

**User Research** (does not have to be formal, just ask questions)

Putting people first by asking:

- what they expect to do
- why that matters to them
- what other goals they have
- what other tools they use  

### identifying user needs

There are 2 general groups of app users: B2B and B2C  

**B2B:**

- ask what **process** they use not which **tools** they use.
- ask open-ended, non-leading questions
  - "what constitutes a good workday for you?"
  - "How do you go about doing _______?"
  - "how does this process compare with other orgs you've worked for?"
  - "what are the biggest probs, obstacles, or inefficiencies you deal with in this process?"
  - "can you tell me about any/all other systems, websites, or apps you use during the day?"

**B2C:**

- don't **solve** problems
- don't **suggest solutions**
- don't **give advice**

Patience is extremely important here; let the silence following the question do the heavy lifting and repress the urge to fill it with your own voice.  

- "what task would you put off as long as you possibly can on a site like this?"
- "what things frustrate you most?"
- "how often do you use sites like this?"
- "what do you use them for most often?"
- "can you show me how you do that?"
- "what other things do you do before, during, or after you use the site?"
- "is there a site that does something similar that you know of?"

# 17. Decision Paths: Connecting User Needs with Strategy

## Decision Paths:

- percieve need
- identify options
- narrow choices
- choose one
- service after sale

## Progressive Disclosure  

![screenshot-020](../img/screenshots-020.jpg)

The most important principle of good UI/UX is **progressive disclosure**.  
Information presented to someone who isn't _interested_ in it - or isn't ready to _process_ it - is **noise**.

# 19. Introduction to Requirements

**GENERATING** Requirements  
(not picking off a tree) 
What needs to be designed/built?
- "Requirements cannot be gathered." - Kim Goodwin
- What users need to be able to _do_ with the site
- Functionality/content/data
- Questions, not _solutions_

# 20. Generating Meaningful Requirements
## Form, Function, and Features

Generate requirements - Don't take orders

# 21. Three Kinds of Requirements

1. What users say they need
2. What they actually need
3. What they didn't know they needed

# 22. Documenting Requirements

Whatever requirments you create, you NEED to document them.  

There is a common misunderstanding that following a Lean or Agile methodology means no documentation of any kind. NOT TRUE!  

It means _*less*_ docs - not _*no*_ docs.  
Could be as simple as a list on a whiteboard, take a picture, paste in a word doc.  

## Documentation promotes understanding  

Documented reference gives the entire team, yours and the client's tow things:
1. A sense of scope of what you're building (and what you're not)
2. A reference point for progress during the website project lifecycle.  

Shared documentation also give you a common way to label and describe things in a manner everybody understands.  

## Documentation eliminates excuses  

- If decisions are documented and shared, anyone, at any time, can pull up that doc and get educated.
- You don't have to write a novel; just capture it somewhere, somehow.
- Make sure every person involved has access to it.
- As requirements are approved, that approval is noted as well.  

### Takeaway:
Documentation eliminates excuses and surprises === makes life good.

# 23. Determining Project Scope

### Takeaway:

When it comes to interacting with clients, partners, or fellow team members: **silence equals agreement.**.

### Takeaway:
If you are doing it without the list, **you're guessing**. Write it down.
